## What is Wayne OS project?
It is a [free/libre and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) OS project based on [Chromium OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_OS).
<br>This project offers useful binaries, source code, documentation, and user support.

## Purpose
Saving [TCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership) of Web thin clients.
<br>This project is intended to be used as an intermediate good in the IT/education industries.

## Use cases
#### Manufacturer
1) Download Wayne OS.
2) Rebrand *Wayne OS* with your own brand.
3) Install the OS on POP/Kiosk/low-spec devices.
4) Sell it under your business.
#### Business
1) Ensure that your office work can be done entirely on the web (ex: working on SaaS, call center).
2) Install Wayne OS on office PCs.
3) Monitor & control the PCs with the [UEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_endpoint_management) server.
#### School
1) Install Wayne OS on school PCs.
2) Use the existing PCs as Chromebooks.
3) Change the OS settings to force/restrict certain websites.
#### Individual
1) Install Wayne OS on a USB flash drive.
2) Use the USB flash drive as normal removable storage with Windows/MacOS.
3) You can also boot/install Wayne OS on any remaining PCs, regardless of the existing OS.

## Comparison of Chrome OS (Flex), Chromium OS, and Wayne OS
#### Common
- Integrity: OS users cannot install/excute virus/code/apps.
- Lightweight: No slowing down (this does not mean that the OS is fast on all devices, as speed depends on HW).
- Easy of use: Simple UI/UX similar to Chrome, with no need for periodic or complex setup and management like with Windows or traditional Linux OS.
#### CROS
- Chrome OS: You have to buy a Chromebook to use it.
- Chrome OS Flex:If you are an end-user, you can download and install it on your PC, but it cannot be used for commercial purposes (copy/modification/distribution is prohibited).
- Chromium OS: The upstream and open source version of Chrome OS (Flex), but you have to build/customize it yourself.
#### Wayne OS
- Pre-built and Customized: A pre-built and customized version of Chromium OS for web thin clients (e.g., industrial devices, educational PCs, low-spec hardware).
- Open: All modified and additional source code (including parts that are not required to be disclosed) is made publicly available. This ensures transparency of the OS's internal logic.
- Free for commercial: Anyone (individuals, profit/nonprofit org, etc.) can use it for commercial purposes (copy/modification/distribution of source code/binary/brand is allowed) under minimal restrictions [licenses](https://github.com/wayne-incorporated/wayne-os/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
- Diversity: Various image types (base/dev/test) and features (e.g., auto login, portable, UEM) are available.
- [Improved live USB](https://github.com/wayne-incorporated/improved-live-usb): Unlike [legacy live USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB), a Wayne OS USB flash drive functions as a removable storage (with OS partitions hidden) in Windows/macOS. Wayne OS portable versions include this feature.
